# Sensitive folder

This folder is where files that contain private data should reside. The files themselves
are not included in the repo for obvious reasons and need to be created by the user
using the structure described below:

## sensitive.py

    EMAIL = "your_email@your_domain"  # Used to create the user agent of the scrapper
